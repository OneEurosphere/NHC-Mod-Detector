**STATUS: WORKING!**

This script was made for the roblox game called [New Haven County](https://www.roblox.com/games/979209050/New-Haven-County).

To use it, you just execute the script while in the game and it'll notify you of the following: 
  - if a mod joins or leaves the server
  - the number of mods currently in the server
  - the names of the mods currently in the server (click on the box thing to show)
